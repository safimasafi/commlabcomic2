Assignment 2 - Comix Strip
Group members: Safeya Alblooshi, Rakan Al Shaibani, Muhammad bin Nauman, Yoki Xue

Project Name: Free Bear Hugs

Safeya: 
The overall concept was that we went with a comic that had to be presented as a flipbook and we wanted to have that as the main theme, a website with multiple flip books. It was a challenge to implement multiple books in one site, given the sizing and coding, so we finalised it as one main flipbook with mouseover events in the sides and the flipping as the interactivity. This also made us realise that the website will look more cleaner like that, and the user interactivity will be a more enjoyable experience as the story line follows a single flipbook and not a multiple. It also allowed us to keep the website structure and content more minimalistic.
I decided to have the background image a replica of the comic to keep the theme going for the overall website, and add the animals with their names on as mouseover events to add some playful elements to the site. I also kept the flipbook very simplistic, without cheesy page turns or sound effects so that it will look very natural to the overall website and less like a book on its own. 
I feel like the website was successful in the end; we started off with very complex ideas of what the site should look like and even wanted the user to have a say in which clothes the bear should wear, but through the weeks we narrowed down our ideas to make it as organis as possible.

Muhammad:
The concept that was purpose was to implement something that allowed user interaction with the comic In a way that the user felt more connected to the contents of the comic. 

The first thing that was tried out in order to achieve this was by implementing a comic that will tell a singular story but with two different perspectives. The one perspective will be of the bear and the other will be of the hedgehog. The idea was to give the user a choice on whose story to follow but by the mid of the project we realised that the selection didn't affect the flow of the story in a significant way so we therefore decided to have one singular path. But to input the interactive part an idea to implement an actual comic book flip animation that lets the user feel a more personal connection with the comic and its pace. Another idea that was to be implemented was giving a sense of time early in the development of the comic but after yoki was done with the panels he decided to not implement them as the comic encompasses a short amount of time with regards to the story.

At the end the project came out looking different than what was proposed in the first day but I think this is more streamlined and goes well with the art style more.


 Yoki:
Our comic is an original fairy tale for children. The story is between a bear offering free hugs and some frustrating animals. It was inspired by my hedgehog Coco. I sometimes can't help but imagine what a hedgehog would do if he/she needs a hug. The comic was finished by Adobe Illustrator. I first sketched the background layout and characters on paper. After watching some AI tutorials, I tried to reproduce the draft digitally. The style I expected was a personified cartoon with bright colors, so I painted the forest and stream as the background with bright green and blue.

One of the tricky parts was to set up layers and divide groups of items. The arrangement of the layers will affect the subsequent addition of other elements and items. If I had not separated layers and groups at the beginning, when more and more elements were added, the entire artboard would be messed up, which wasted a lot of time to adjust and reset. Another difficulty is to paint objects that have a three-dimensional sense, such as the stream in the middle of the grassland. The height, width, and thickness of the object need to be taken into account, and that requires an understanding of perspectivity, spacing, and shading. It could be a challenge for people like me who have no previous experience with painting. It took me long to adjust features to get the desired effect.
